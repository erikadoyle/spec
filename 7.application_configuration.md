# 7. Application Configuration

**Target Roles: Application Operator, Application Developer**

This section describes how applications are deployed using application configurations.

A component can be deployed into any number of runtimes, any number of times. Each deployment of a component is called an _instance_. Each time a component is deployed, it must be deployed _with a configuration_. This section of the specification describes configurations.

An _application configuration_ (sometimes abbreviated to _configuration_) is managed by the _application operator_ role, and provides information specific to the current instance of a component. The following information is considered specific to the runtime instance of a component:

- Information about the particular instance, such as:
    - Name
    - Release version
    - Description
- Values for the defined `parameters` for a component, and for its respective components
- Trait assignments to add operational functionality, together with any trait configuration

## Instances and upgrades

An _instance_ is a trackable deployment of an application configuration. A _component instance_ is an instance of a component that is created during the deployment of an application configuration. It is created when a component is deployed together with a configuration. Each subsequent _upgrade_ of a component will modify the given instance after the application configuration is redeployed. And each subsequent upgrade of an application configuration can modify any of the component instances controlled by that application configuration. For the purposes of this specification, workflow practices such as _rollback_ or _redeploy_  are considered to be special cases of _upgrade_ (that is, if the rules here apply to upgrade, they also apply to the other workflow practices). When a deployment of a component is _deleted_, the instance is considered to be deleted. This does not, however, imply that all data related to the instance must be deleted, or that deletion events cannot be recovered or undone.

When an instance is first created, it is in its _initial release state_. Each time an upgrade operation occurs, we say that a new _release_ of that instance occurs. (There is, however, no assumption that there is a corresponding `release` object stored somewhere).

### Releases

In [*Twelve-Factor Applications*](https://12factor.net/), a release is defined as a [build plus a set of configs](https://12factor.net/build-release-run). That is, any change to either a build or configuration produces a new release. In the Open Application Model, the analog is that component, trait, and scope definitions combined with an application configuration jointly constitute a release.

For OAM applications, a release is defined thus:

> A release is a named application configuration, together with its description of correlated components, scopes, and traits

In addition, as an application configuration is released, its _component instances_ (running copies of a named component) are also released.

To accommodate this definition of a release, an OAM platform SHOULD make the following assumptions:

- A component (as defined in the [component model](4.component.md) section) is immutable. It should not be changed after creation.
- Any change to an [application configuration](4.application_configuration.md) results (conceptually) in a new release that supersedes older releases.
  * If an application configuration is updated, and the new version includes components not present in the original application configuration, component instances MUST be created
  * If an application configuration is updated, and the new version does not have a record of a component that the previous application configuration contained, that component instance MUST be deleted
  * Traits similarly SHOULD be attached and detached according to the same guidelines
  * Components' relationships to Application Scopes SHOULD be applied or removed according to the same guidelines

## Runtime and Application Configuration

The [Workload](3.workload.md) chapter of the specification defines how schematics are constructed. The resulting schematics may then be used to instantiate a component on a OAM-compliant runtime.

A component can be deployed into numerous different runtimes. However, at runtime there is a one-to-one correspondence between an _instance of a configuration_ and an _application configuration_.

Conceptually speaking, an application configuration is managed as part of the _application operator_ role. An application configuration includes one or more component instances, each represented by a component definition that defines how an instance of a component spec should be deployed. The component definition has three parts:
  - Overrides of component parameters
  - List of traits, each of which has overrides for that trait's parameters
  - List of application scopes into which the component should be deployed

## Defining an application configuration

### Top-Level Attributes

The top-level attributes of a application configuration define its metadata, version, kind, and spec.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || The specific version of the specification in use. This version of the specification covers `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2`. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || Must be `ApplicationConfiguration` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](2.overview_and_terminology.md#metadata) | Y | | Information about the application configuration. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A specification for application configuration attributes. |

### Spec

The specification defines parameters that can be overridden at deployment time, and a set of scopes and component instances to create.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `components` | [`[]Component`](#component) | Y | | Component instance definitions. |

### Component

This section defines the instances of components to create with the application configuration.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `componentName` | `string` | Y | | The name of the component of which to create an instance. |
| `parameterValues` | [`[]ParameterValue`](#parameterValue) | N | | Overrides of parameters that are exposed by the application scope type defined in `type`. |
| `scopes` | [`[]Scope`](#scope) | N | | The scopes to be used in the component. A component joins a scope by referencing it. |
| `traits` | [`[]Trait`](#trait) | N | | The traits to attach to this component instance. |

In addition to being unique, the `componentName` must follow these naming rules:

> The componentName field is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

### Scope

The scope section defines the scope into which the component should be deployed.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `scopeRef` | [`ScopeRef`](#scopeRef) | Y | | The reference information of the Scope. |

### ScopeRef

The scopeRef section will index a scope instance by `apiVersion`, `kind` and `name`.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y | | The apiVersion of the Scope. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y | | The kind of the Scope. |
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The name of the Scope. |

> The name field is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

### Trait

The trait section defines an instance of a trait.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `trait` | [`TraitData`](#traitdata) | N | | Information required by a trait definition. |

### TraitData

The TraitData section contains the instantiation of the [schema](3.traits.md#DefinitionRef) referenced by the corresponding `traitDefinition`. The schema can be used to validated this section.

It is RECOMMENDED that `apiVersion` and `kind` are specified, for example:

``` yaml
- trait:
    apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
    kind: ManualScalerTrait
    spec:
      replica: 2
```

### ParameterValue

Values supplied to parameters that are used to override the parameters exposed by other types.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The name of the component parameter for which to provide a value. |
| `value` | `string` | Y || The value of the parameter. |

A `name` consists of any Unicode letter or numeric character, and also `_` (underscore), `-` (en dash), and `.` (period). A `value` contains any sequence of printable Unicode characters.

## Example

The following is an example of a complete YAML file that expresses configuration and traits. This example illustrates the four configurational elements of a component: its name, parameter values, traits, and scopes.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: ApplicationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "Description of this deployment"
spec:
  components:
    - componentName: my-web-app-component
      parameterValues:
        - name: PARAMETER_NAME
          value: SUPPLIED_VALUE
        - name: ANOTHER_PARAMETER
          value: "AnotherValue"
      traits:
        - name: manualscaler.core.oam.dev
          version: v1
          spec:
            replicaCount: 3
      scopes:
        - scopeRef:
            apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
            kind: NetworkScope
            name: example-vpc-network
```

The example above illustrates a complete application configuration, including its scopes, component instances and their traits, and parameter overrides which can be specified from the command line at the time of deployment.
