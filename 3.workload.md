# 3. Workload Definition

**Target Audience: Infrastructure Operator** 

This section defines the workload definition schematics.

Workload definitions are authored by an infrastructure operator or platform builder. A workload definition defines the kind of components that an application developer can use in an application, along with the component's schema.

The purpose of workload definitions is to provide a way for an infrastructure operator or platform builder to define what components are available to application developers on a given platform. Workload definitions can define custom schemas for any type of workload. Examples include container pods, serverless functions, data stores, message queues, or any other kind of workload that an application developer needs to design a complete application.

Usually, workload definitions are provided by the OAM runtime (just as traits are) so that application developers may inspect the OAM runtime and learn what workloads are available for use.  

## Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. They follow the [Kubernetes specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields).

Here are the attributes that provide top-level information about the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y | | The specific version of the specification in use. The core types use `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || The string `WorkloadDefinition` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](#metadata) | Y | | WorkloadDefinition metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y | | A container for the workload definition. |

### Metadata

The metadata section describes the workload definition. See [*metadata*](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Metadata).

### Spec

The specification section contains a reference to the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `definitionRef` | [`DefinitionRef`](#DefinitionRef) | Y | | Workload schema reference. |

#### DefinitionRef

DefinitionRef defines an index to find the workload schema.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | Name of the workload schema. |

The workload schema definition itself MUST contain information that can be used to uniquely identify it. An OAM runtime will use that information in a [Component](4.component.md) to refer to the workload schema instead of using the name of the workload definition.

The following conventions are RECOMMENDED:

- Use [Group/Version/Kind](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Group) to uniquely identify the schema.

- `name` follows the format described in [*Group, Version, and Kind*](2.overview_and_terminology.md).

- The `name` of the WorkloadDefinition is the same as the `name` to which it refers.

    For example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
    kind: WorkloadDefinition
    metadata:
      name: schema.example.oam.dev
    spec:
      definitionRef:
        name: schema.example.oam.dev
    ```

## Categories of Workload

There are three categories of workloads:

__Core workloads__ are the kind of workloads that every OAM runtime MUST implement according to spec definition.

__Standard workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime MAY implement. However, the implementation MUST strictly adhere to the schematics defined in the spec. 

__Extended workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime is free to define.

### Core Workload

A core workload schema MUST be in the `core.oam.dev` group. OAM implementations MUST implement all core workloads as defined in this specification.

Here is an example of a core workload definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: x.core.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.core.oam.dev
```

### Standard Workload

A standard workload schema MUST be in the `standard.oam.dev` group. OAM implementations are NOT REQUIRED to implement standard workloads. However, if an implementation implements a workload that is already defined by a standard workload, it SHOULD use the standard workload definition as defined in this specification. Here is an example of a standard workload definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: x.standard.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.standard.oam.dev
```

### Extended Workload

Each OAM runtime may define its own workload definition beyond this specification. Any workload definition that is not part of the _core_ or _standard_ group is considered an extended workload. The name and schema of extended workloads are entirely at the discretion of the OAM implementation.

 Here is an example of an extended workload:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: foo.cache.io
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: foo.cache.io
```

## Core Workload definitions

The following core workloads are defined in the OAM specification.

### Containerized Workload

A containerized workload is used for long-running workloads in containers. See [*Containerized Workload*](core/workloads/containerized_workload/containerized_workload.md).
